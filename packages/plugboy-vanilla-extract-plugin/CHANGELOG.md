# @fastkit/plugboy-vanilla-extract-plugin

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#31](https://github.com/dadajam4/fastkit/pull/31) [`8e04503f`](https://github.com/dadajam4/fastkit/commit/8e04503f7acb585f50ceb482af0128e2263a94f9) Thanks [@dadajam4](https://github.com/dadajam4)! - A helper has been added for defining global variables with layers.

  This helper is a temporary fix for the fact that vanilla-extract does not properly output all variables when outputting layered global styles. This feature may be deprecated when an official fix is made.
