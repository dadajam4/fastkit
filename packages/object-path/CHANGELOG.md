# @fastkit/object-path

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`d63b1af`](https://github.com/dadajam4/fastkit/commit/d63b1af8bf1bb131590ff540af82428cc60aeb7e) Thanks [@dadajam4](https://github.com/dadajam4)! - Strip the dangling `//# sourceMappingURL=*.d.mts.map` comment from emitted declaration files.

  tsdown (rolldown) appends this comment to every `.d.(m)ts` it emits but does not emit the referenced declaration map, so consumers' editors/build tools fail to resolve it. plugboy now removes the comment during build — but only when the referenced map is genuinely absent, so it becomes a no-op automatically if a future tsdown starts emitting real declaration maps.

  Every package in this monorepo is built by plugboy, so this patch re-publishes them all with declaration files that no longer point at a missing map.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b824e71`](https://github.com/dadajam4/fastkit/commit/b824e7136b57649d7958e257c21e8704267380e6) Thanks [@dadajam4](https://github.com/dadajam4)! - Release due to package bundler change. No functional changes included.

- Release accompanying the plugboy bundler migration (tsup → tsdown).

  No API changes are intended for this package. The minor bump exists because the package is rebuilt with the new bundler (tsdown / rolldown), and is published together so any incidental output differences are versioned explicitly.
