### Minor Changes

- Updated major dependencies.

  This release also includes the following behavioral change:

  Previously, this package used only a single element specified with `data-disabled-reason-container` as the target for displaying the disabled reason. Starting with this version, **all child elements contained within the specified container** will act as targets. This change improves the UI for cases where multiple disabled child elements exist, such as in a group of checkboxes.
