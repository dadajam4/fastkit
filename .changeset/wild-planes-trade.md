'@fastkit/vue-stack': patch
---

- Removed package [vue-color-scheme](https://github.com/dadajam4/fastkit/tree/main/packages/vue-color-scheme) that were no longer needed.
- Fixed the `allowOverflow` setting on the menu component so that it will properly extend off the screen instead of trying to fit inside the screen.
