'@fastkit/plugboy-vanilla-extract-plugin': patch
---

A helper has been added for defining global variables with layers.

This helper is a temporary fix for the fact that vanilla-extract does not properly output all variables when outputting layered global styles. This feature may be deprecated when an official fix is made.
