# Contribution

If you are considering contributing to the project I would be happy.
Fastkit is a collection of small packages intended to be used in a variety of applications.

As the maintainer is working on the product outside of daily business hours, it can be difficult to respond quickly, but bug reports and feature requests are welcome.

You are also welcome to contribute to the code. Please read the guide below and send us a pull request.
